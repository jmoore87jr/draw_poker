# draw_poker
Monte Carlo simulator for 2-7 draw poker games

The simulator currently has 2 functions: 

1. deal() only takes an argument for the # of simulations. It deals 5 cards and categorizes the hand into 7-hi thru pair+
2. draw() takes arguments for starting hand, # of draws, # of simulations, and maximum rank to keep for each draw. It outputs the frequency of hands 7-hi thru pair+ after drawing.

Future plans:

1. input 2 hands
2. range vs. range equity graph after draw
